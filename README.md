This bundle provides a set of tools to help you build your Symfony application using the Hexagonal Architecture.
Hexagonal Architecture is an architectural pattern that helps you to decouple your application from the outside world.
It is also known as Ports and Adapters pattern. It is a way of implementing the Clean Architecture. 

## Installation
*Note*: we recommend using Symfony Flex to install this bundle with `devscast/symfony-hexa-skeleton` as it will install all the required dependencies and configuration.

```bash
composer require devscast/symfony-hexa-bundle
```
